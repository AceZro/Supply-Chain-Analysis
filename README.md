Supply Chain Dashboard Project

Overview
This project is a comprehensive supply chain analysis and dashboard created in Microsoft Excel. It is designed to provide insights into supply chain metrics such as inventory levels, order lead times, demand forecasting, and more. By leveraging advanced Excel formulas and visualizations, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making across key operational areas within the supply chain.

Features
- Interactive Dashboard: Includes visualizations for tracking key supply chain metrics.
- Advanced Excel Functions: Uses functions like VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and SUMIF for data aggregation and processing.
- Pivot Tables: Simplifies data manipulation, allowing for flexible and dynamic data analysis.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Ensures data accuracy by standardizing and cleaning raw data inputs.
- Demand Forecasting & Cost Analysis: Uses complex calculations for improved predictive accuracy.

Project Structure
- Supply-Chain-Dashboard.xlsx: The main Excel file that contains the interactive dashboard, raw data, and data processing sheets.
- README.md: Documentation file providing an overview, setup instructions, and usage details.

Getting Started
1. Download the Excel file: [Supply-Chain-Dashboard.xlsx](./Supply Chain Analysis.xlsx).
2. Open the file in Microsoft Excel (preferably version 2016 or newer for compatibility).
3. Review the "Data" sheet for raw data inputs. Modify this sheet if you wish to analyze different data sets.
4. Navigate to the "Dashboard" sheet to view the visualizations and analyze the supply chain metrics.

How to Use the Dashboard
1. Data Input: Update the raw data in the "Data" sheet, which will automatically feed into the dashboard visualizations.
2. Interactivity: Use the slicers and filters embedded in the dashboard to adjust time periods, categories, or other variables as needed.
3. Analysis: Review trends and insights to identify areas for improvement in the supply chain, such as inventory optimization or demand forecast accuracy.

Key Insights
- Inventory Optimization: Analyzes historical trends to suggest optimal inventory levels, aiming to reduce costs.
- Order Lead Time: Identifies lead time trends to help streamline order processes and enhance operational efficiency.
- Forecast Accuracy: Uses historical data to provide more accurate demand forecasts, improving the alignment of supply with demand.

Technical Details
- Software: Microsoft Excel 2016 or later
- Key Functions: VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIF, Pivot Tables
- Data Visualization: Charts, slicers, and pivot tables for a user-friendly and interactive experience

Dependencies
- Microsoft Excel: Required for full functionality of formulas and interactive elements.
